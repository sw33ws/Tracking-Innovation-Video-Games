                        Over the years - starting as early as 1950, continuing on and growing in both popularity and relevance in culture -
                        Video Games have been a part of many lives all around the world.

                    The Origin of Video Games [1950 - 1970]
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        Created primarily for ‘educational purposes’ or for family entertainment, video games stem from the roots of board 
                        games – giving many of the basic concepts, principles, and rules we follow today within video games directly from 
                        these older generational activities. 
                    </p>

                <h3>
                    X-O-X : Noughts & Crosses (1952)
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        Created by A.S. Douglas at Cambridge University, this was a tic-tac-toe simulator, in which the user would face off 
                        against the computer, which would typically play a perfect game.
                    </p>

                <h3>
                    Tennis for Two! (Predecessor to Pong!) (1958)
                </h3>
  
                    <p>
                        Created by William Higinbotham in Upton, New York at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The first release was on October 18, 1958
                        , during “Annual Visitor Day”.  This game consisted of two players, a ‘ball’, and two aluminum controllers with a knob and
                        button while playing the players would press the button and aim using the knob to get the ‘ball’ over the ‘net’. 
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In some context, this is referred to as the very first video game, as it was the first to be created purely as a source of 
                        entertainment, rather than used for academic research or boosting commercial technology sales. While reading the manual for the 
                        Donner Model 30 analog computer – he learned that the computer could accurately calculate the trajectories of a bouncing ball
                        or missiles, with wind resistance incorporated, and decided to use that ability to form the foundation of the game.

                <h3>Spacewar! (1962) </h3>
                    <p>
                        Steve Russel and collaborators created one of the first video games in 1962: “Spacewar!”. The game was written for the
                        newly installed Programmed Data Processor-1 computer (PDP-1) – the first to spread to other computer installations –
                        “Spacewar!” became the first known game to be played at multiple computer installations.

                <h3> The Brown Box (1967) / The Magnavox Odyssey (1972)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Magnavox Odyssey was inspirational for many game makers to come. It came with 28 individual games included, a 
                        revolutionary innovation for its time as the first home console created. The console although short-lived, allowed 
                        Magnavox to win more than 100 million dollars in copyright lawsuits related to the Odyssey and its patents against many
                        competitor companies.

                    The Golden Arcade Era [1970 - 1982]
                </h2>

                <p>
                    This Era is known for it's large arcade crowds - massive technological innovations, and the birth of multiple 
                    multi-million dollar companies & Silicon Valley itself. Atari, founded in 1972, being a leader in many of these
                    innovations, such as successful releases into the Arcade and Home Markets. They led the industry by creating a
                    console with interchangable cartridges,   
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Atari: Pong! (1972 & 1975)
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        Inspired by Tennis for Two, created by Allan Alcorn – Pong! was one of the most successful arcade releases of all time
                        for game company Atari. The game was created as a trial of Allan’s abilities as he was newly hired – and ended up 
                        being successful enough Atari heavily invested into the game so much so that Magnavox sued Atari due to copyright 
                        infringement, resulting in Atari becoming an Odyssey Licensee.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Following their initial successful release within the American arcades - Atari decided to change the game, by releasing
                        a home version of their popular game - resulting in yet another succesful launch into a new market for Atari - reaching
                        Americans within not only arcades but also their homes!

                    Innovation in Cartridges - What's the Channel F?
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        Cartridges themself were a revolution in the Video Game Industry. One of the first cartridges to market was Atari's Pong!
                        cartridge - but imagine living in a world where you can only play one game on an system? Fairchild Camera and Instrument released
                        the Channel F in November 1976. This system introduced the first interchangable cartridges to the industry, but however was shadowed 
                        by Atari's console release shortly thereafter.

                        With the video game market booming, Atari again looked to further meet their player and customer needs,
                        releasing a brand new innovational console with the Atari 2600.

                    <p>
                        This console took the market by storm, shadowing it's predecessors came equipped with joysticks,
                        and interchangable cartridges that had multi-colour capability. This caused a technological jump in
                        the home console market, giving Atari a foothold in the industry holding a large marketshare for the
                        following 15 years.
